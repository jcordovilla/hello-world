# hello-world
My first repository...wehey!
My name is Jose Cordovilla. I am a civil engineer with experience as a consultant in the infrastructure investment sector.
I have decided I want to develop data analysis applications to level-up my professional skills, so it seems a necessary step to get acquainted with GitHub.
